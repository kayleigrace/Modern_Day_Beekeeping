                <h2>Small Scale Orange County Beekeeper</h2>
                
                <p>Steve Wernett, a beekeeper in Orange County, CA maintains 880 colonies on just under half an acre. But Wernett recalls his introduction to beekeeping  differently. Wernett is old fashioned, he grew up with a beekeeper that only put 40-80 colonies per location. That was a time when beekeepers kept their hives about two miles apart so there was room for the honey bees to forage. It was also an era of cotton fields and honey production in the San Joaquin Valley.</p>
                
                <p>But the land he recalls as being heavily subsidized for cotton farming now boasts orchards of almond, pistachio, and cherry trees. Cotton fields were a staple diet for honey bees, but as the fields have slowly disappeared, honey has become a less lucrative business. Pollination contracts have become the new gold mine.</p>
                
                <h2>Wernett dubs pollination contracts  'Feedlot Beekeeping'</h2>
                
                <p>Almond orchards are heavily reliant on honey bees for cross pollination, even the minority of self-pollinating almond tree groves benefit from honey bees increasing their yields. The demand for honey bees has skyrocketed. Now, Wernett is in business with other beekeepers across the nation who have doubled or tripled the amount of colonies they have but maintained the same plots of land. </p>
                
                <p>The once old fashioned beekeeping honey business Wernett knew has disappeared and now he dubs it <strong>‘feedlot beekeeping.’</strong> Bees all over the country are packed in and being fattened up on sugar water and artificial feed to be delivered to a five county area of almond groves in California.</p>
                
                
                <p>Wernett explains adapting is a necessary economical choice in the beekeeping world today.</p>

                <h2>Quantity versus Quality</h2>
                
            <p> Wernett's experience with almond growers is different than the narrative often seen in the media.</p> 
            <p> Large-scale beekeepers from out of state have described it as 'sending bees to war.' These beekeepers often have weaker colonies that are hit harder by the transmission of mites that happens at monoculture pollination sites. Additionally, some growers spray insecticides and fungicides which can be detrimental to colonies. As a result, large-scale beekeeping colony numbers often fluctuate and sometimes see colony collapse.</p>
            <p>Wernett is able to maintian his colonies of 860-880 consistently year around because of his smaller size. Wernett's colonies retail for $225, about $55 more than the average colony. This is because Wernett's colonies are so strong that growers only need to use 1 colony per acre in comparison to the typical 2 colonies per acre. Wernett appreciates the health checks higher-scale growers do before taking the bees on site- something large-scale beekeepers often dread and avoid by going to locations that are more lax.
            But these less strict locations may be putting the honey bees at greater risk of getting sprayed and intercating with other unhealthy colonies.  
            <p>Small-scale beekeepers do less pollination contracts at a higher cost and in return ensure the health of their bees. If more growers opt for healthier honey bees, they can use less colonies per acre. All of this raises the question of quantity versus quality. </p>
